# AI-Driven Web-Based Academic Recruitment System for Nigerian Educational Institutions

## Objective
To simulate and model an AI-driven academic recruitment system using NLP and ML techniques for automated job matching, bias detection, and fairness evaluation.

## Simulation Type
Web-Based AI System / NLP & ML Simulation

## Types of Dataset
1. Academic CVs/resumes
2. job postings
3. institutional criteria
4. user interaction logs
5. feedback forms

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. Kaggle CV datasets
2. Nigerian job boards (e.g. Jobberman)
3. academic job repositories
4. manually curated local content

## Dataset URLs

## Setup Instructions
1. 1. Scrape or collect academic job listings and sample CVs
2. 2. Preprocess resumes using NLP techniques (tokenization, parsing, entity recognition)
3. 3. Apply ML models (e.g., TF-IDF, BERT embeddings, cosine similarity) to predict candidate-job fit
4. 4. Implement ML models for bias detection in candidate selection (e.g., fairness constraints, explainable AI techniques like LIME or SHAP)
5. 5. Simulate candidate-job matching using the trained models and evaluate fairness metrics (e.g., gender neutrality, diversity index)

## Implementation Guide
1. 1. Develop and train NLP models for resume parsing and job description matching
2. 2. Train machine learning algorithms for job matching prediction (e.g., supervised classifiers, recommendation systems)
3. 3. Implement models for detecting biases in recommendations
4. 4. Visualise bias detection results and candidate matching performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and fairness indices

## Expected Output(s)
1. 1. NLP-based CV parsing and job matching with predictive accuracy
2. 2. Evaluation of fairness (e.g.
3. gender bias detection)
4. 3. Visualisation of matching performance (e.g.
5. ROC curves
6. confusion matrix)
7. 4. Report on system's bias and accuracy metrics
